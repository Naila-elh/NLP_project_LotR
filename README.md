# NLP project for ENSAE class *Apprentissage statistique appliqué* (Applied statistical learning).

Zoé Fontier and I did this assigment for our class *"Apprentissage statistique appliqué"* at ENSAE. 
We were asked to find a text and apply the NLP algorithms (word2vec) we studied in class to this text. 
We chose the scripts of the movies "The Lord of the Rings", available on [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/lord-of-the-rings-data).
